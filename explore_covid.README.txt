To play with these examples, you probably don't need much beyond

+ A recentish Python (>= 3.6)
+ liquidata.py from this directory (can be installed with pip)
+ pandas
+ matplotlib

and the dependencies of the last two.

Then simply try `python explore_covid.py`.

(The first time you do this, it will download UN population data into the
working directory.)

Use ipython or jupyter to make interactive experimentation easier.

Fiddle around with the pipeline defined at the bottom of explore_covid.py.
